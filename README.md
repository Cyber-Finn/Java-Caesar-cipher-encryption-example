# Caesar-cipher
This code sample demonstrates how the Rotary-based Caesar cipher works to provide very basic encryption. 
<br>
Note that this is not a secure method of encryption, and should only ever be used as an example for cybersecurity students to learn the caesar cipher.
<br>

## Usage:
The app works by taking a user-input, then turning it into an "encrypted/obscured" text, then gives you the opportunity to reverse the encryption, by decrypting the info. 
<br>
Of course, if any of the data is encrypted, then changed, the original message will be lost - as is the case with actual encrypted messages
